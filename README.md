Just my personal folder for my suckless utilities and configurations for such. Contains DWM configuration and ST configuration. Will update as I apply patches to both.  
If you have any questions about either of these, please feel free to ask, although I doubt I'll be able to answer them. List of changed keybinds follows:  
~ Iain xx  

Keybinds (only custom ones are here, everything else is deafult):  
        
        Mod1 (Left Alt) == Mod4 (Windows key)
        Mod + t == opens terminal
        Mod + b == opens browser (opera by default)
        Mod + d == opens discord (Much like browser, programs need to be installed)
        Mod + Shift + t == tiling mode
        Mod + Shift + d == decrease the number of windows on master in tiling mode
